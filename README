Data
----

You can grab the data from http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/namefiles.htm
(that is freely [as in free beer!] available).

The whole countries database is about 1.7Gb, queries performances are for
the moment too slow to use that one, but you should need only one
(maybe two, at least) country.

Download the file you want to import (ie. fr.zip), and unzip it under a
location your database server can read in (typically
/var/lib/mysql for MySQL or /var/lib/pgsql for PostgreSQL).

MySQL
-----

To import txt file in the database, first copy the file so it can be read
from mysql (say /var/lib/mysql/fr.txt), then login as galette user
on your galette database and then run the LOAD DATA command:
$ mysql -u galette -P galette
mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE '/var/lib/mysql/fr.txt' INTO TABLE galette_maps_towns;


PostgreSQL
----------

To import txt file in the database, first copy the file so it can be read
from postgres (say /var/lib/pgsql/fr.txt), then login as postgres user
on your galette database and then run the COPY command:
$ psql -u postgres galette
galette=# COPY galette_maps_towns FROM '/var/lib/pgsql/fr.txt' WITH CSV HEADER DELIMITER E'\t' QUOTE '|';
